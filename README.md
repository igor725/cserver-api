# cserver-lua-api

API documentation for the [CServer](https://github.com/igor725/cserver)

Compiled version of the docs hosted at [docs.igvx.ru](https://docs.igvx.ru/)

## Hosting own documentation

First of all, you need to install mkdocs and some dependencies:
```
python3 -m pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-static-i18n
```

MkDocs comes with a built-in server that lets you preview the documentation. Make sure you're in the root directory of the repo, and then start the server by running `mkdocs serve` command. Now you can use printed in the console URL to open the documentation.
For more information please read [Getting Started with MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/).
